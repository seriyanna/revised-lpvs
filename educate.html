                <br>
                  <p> A programming language is a means of communication between programmers (developers) and computers. A set of rules called a programming language enables the conversion of textual values into different ways of producing machine code, or in the case of visual programming languages, graphical elements.
                    In general, a program is a set of instructions created in a certain language (such as C, C++, Java, or Python) to do a specific purpose.

              <h2><ul>Java</ul></h2>
              <br>
              <p>One of the most widely used programming languages today is Java, which is owned by Oracle Corporation. Due to its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) characteristics, it has established itself as a standard for applications that can be utilized on any platform. It is widely used in large data, online and application development, as well as on the backend of many well-known websites. Popular new Java frameworks include Spring, Struts, and Hibernate. There is a sizable online community of Java programmers who help one another overcome issues.</p>

              <h2><ul>PHP</ul></h2>
              <br>
              <p> PHP is an open-source programming language created in 1990 that is used to build more than 80% of websites on the Internet. It is mainly used to write server-side scripts, but can also be used to write command-line scripts and desktop applications. It is considered a relatively easy language to learn for beginning developers, and has access to several dedicated online communities.</p>

                <h2><ul> C# </ul></h2>
                <br>
                <p>A programming language created by Microsoft, became popular in the 2000s for supporting object-oriented programming ideas. Its designer, Anders Hejlsberg, claims it is more comparable to C++ than Java. It uses Microsoft Visual C++, an integrated development environment, and works best for software on Windows, Android, and iOS. Several well-known websites use C#
                     as their backend programming language.</p>

                <br>
                <p>C is the oldest and most popular programming language, and is the root of other programming languages such as C#, Java, and JavaScript. C++ is an enhanced version of C, and is widely used in computer science and programming. C and C++ developers can make use of compilers for a wide variety of platforms, making applications largely transportable. Both languages are considered high-performance languages.</p>

                <br>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the popular language for creating websites and computer programs. It enables the creation of structured documents by specifying the structural semantics of text elements including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotations, and other objects. HTML elements are separated by tags, which are denoted by writing surrounded by angles. To incorporate photos and other items into the finished page, HTML structures can be employed.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a style sheet language that is used to specify how a page created using a markup language is displayed. A style sheet, or collection of rules for web browsers, can manage an HTML or XML document.
                    The CSS styling is applied to all HTML tags, including the body text, headings, paragraphs, and other text components. Components of the grid, table, and image display.

                <br>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language used for client-side development, but is now also used to deploy server-side websites and create applications for platforms other than web browsers. It was developed in 1995 and was marketed as Java's "younger brother" until it became an autonomous language. Although there are some similarities between Java and JavaScript, the two languages are now frequently mistaken with one another.</p>

                <p>One of the most widely used programming languages today, Python is simple to learn for novices. It is a free, open-source programming language with many community development and support modules, simple web service integration, user-friendly data structures, and desktop programs with a graphical user interface. Websites, video games, scientific and computational applications, and 2D and 3D animation software are all created using it.

                <br>
                <p>A common database query language is SQL. Data in databases can be accessed and changed using it. In declarative languages like SQL, the desired outcomes are specified but not the procedures to get there. SQL is the most extensively used database query language in the world and is a strong tool for accessing and modifying data.</p>
